      The zoo has officially reopened but we still need your help!

    <p class="donate__text">
      Even though the Zoo has been able to reopen, we are at a greatly reduced
      capacity with educational programs and public and private events cancelled
      or postponed for additional months. We need you now more than ever to help
      ensure that we overcome these challenges. We have been actively raising
      funds in the community, and we are grateful for the generosity. But much
      more support is still needed, and we need your help! Please consider a
      gift today – no matter what size – to help us sustain our mission.
